# Housing History

Housing History quietly keeps track of everything you do while decorating your
FFXIV house. Whenever you place, remove, move, rotate, or dye a furnishing, it
writes it down with a timestamp and the exact coordinates, so you can look back
at what you just did and put things right if you change your mind. Think of it as
the memory that goes with Burning Down the House. BDTH handles the precise
placement, and this one remembers how everything used to be.

> By default it just watches and never touches your house.

## Features

- Logs every placement, removal, move, rotation, and dye change, each with a timestamp.
- Shows coordinates for everything. Click one to copy it, then paste it back into
  BDTH to undo a move.
- Apply mode (optional): click a coordinate and the item you have selected in
  layout mode jumps right to it, so undoing a move is a single click.
- Item icons and dye color swatches so the log is easy to skim.
- Search, filters for each kind of change, and a quick "today" summary.
- When you come back to a house, it shows you what changed while you were away.
- Remembers your history between sessions.
- Opens itself when the housing menu shows up (you can turn this off).
- Keeps separate history for each of your houses.

## Install

1. In-game, open `/xlsettings`, go to **Experimental**, then **Custom Plugin Repositories**.
2. Add this URL and enable it:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenteakitkats/DalamudPlugins/main/repo.json
   ```
3. Open `/xlplugins`, search for **Housing History**, and click **Install**.

> The repository manifest lives in
> [greenteakitkats/DalamudPlugins](https://github.com/greenteakitkats/DalamudPlugins),
> which is shared across all of these plugins and updates itself from each new release.

## Usage

- Type `/houselog` to open the log.
- Each row shows the time, the action, the item, and its coordinates (or the dye
  change for recolors).
- Click any coordinate to copy it. On a move, the greyed "from" line is the value
  you paste back into BDTH to put something back where it was.
- Use the checkboxes to choose which changes to show, and the search box to find a
  specific item.
- Turn on Apply mode if you'd rather click a coordinate and have the selected item
  jump straight there.
- Type `/houselog dump` to print a quick diagnostics snapshot to `/xllog` (handy
  right after a game patch).

## Good to know

- For now it only tracks furnishings indoors.
- It can tell you what changed, but not who did it. The game doesn't share that
  with plugins.
- Out of the box it only watches and never changes anything, which keeps it in line
  with Dalamud's plugin rules. Apply mode is the one exception, and even then it only
  nudges the item you already have selected, exactly the way Burning Down the House does.
